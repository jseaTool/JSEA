the graphical composite figure can be configure with any figure which take over the task rendering the graphical presentation a composite figure therefore the graphical composite figure manage contain figure like the composite figure doe but delegate it graphical presentation to another graphical figure which purpose it is to draw the container all contain figure the graphical composite figure add to the link composite figure composite figure by contain a presentation figure by which can not be remove normally the link composite figure composite figure can not be see without contain a figure because it ha no mechanism to draw itself it instead relie on it contain figure to draw themselve thereby giving the link composite figure composite figure it appearance howev the b graphical composite figure b s presentation figure can draw itself even when the b graphical composite figure b contain no other figure the b graphical composite figure b also us a link layout layout or layout
