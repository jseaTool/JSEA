layout layout manager java io serializable hgap vgap row col is vertical true create a grid layout with a of one column p component in a single row vertical grid layout 1 0 0 0 create a grid layout with the specify number of row and column all component in the layout are given equal size p one but not both of code row code and code col code can be zero which mean that any number of object can be place in a row or in a column param row the row with the value zero meaning any number of row param col the column with the value zero meaning any number of column vertical grid layout row col row col

component in the layout are given equal size p in addition the horizontal and vertical gap are set to the specify value horizontal gap are place at the left and right edge and between each of the column vertical gap are place at the top and bottom edge and between each of the row p one but not both of code row code and code col code can be zero which mean that any number of object can be place
