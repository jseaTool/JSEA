component in a single row create a grid layout with the specify number of row and column all component in the layout are given equal size p one but not both of code row code and code col code can be zero which mean that any number of object can be place in a row or in a column param row the row with the value zero meaning any number of row param col the column with the value zero meaning any number of column create a grid layout with the specify number of row and column all component in the layout are given equal size p in addition the horizontal and vertical gap are set to the specify value horizontal gap are place at the left and right edge and between each of the column vertical gap are place at the top and bottom edge and between each of the row p one but not both of code row code and code col code can be zero which mean that any number of object can be place in a row or in a column p all code vertical grid layout code constructor defer to one param row the row with the value zero meaning any number of row param col the column with the value zero meaning any number of column param hgap the horizontal gap param vgap the vertical gap exception illegal argument exception the value of both code row code and code col code is set to zero get the number of row in layout the number of row in layout since j d k1 1 set the number of row in layout to the specify value param row the number of row in layout exception illegal argument exception the value of both code row code and code col code is set to zero since j d k1 1 get the number of column in layout the number of column in layout since j d k1 1 set the number of column in layout to the specify value setting the number of column ha no affect on the layout the number of row specify by a constructor or by the tt set row tt method is non zero in that the number of column display in the layout is determine by the total number of component and the number of row specify param col the number of column in layout exception illegal argument exception the value of both code row code and code col code is set to zero since j d k1 1 get the horizontal gap between component the horizontal gap between component since j d k1 1 set the horizontal gap between component to the specify value param hgap the horizontal gap between component since j d k1 1 get the vertical gap between component the vertical gap between component since j d k1 1 set the vertical gap between component to the specify value param vgap the vertical gap between component since j d k1 1 add the specify component with the specify name to the layout param name the name of the component param comp the component to be add remove the specify component from the layout param comp the component to be remove determine the prefer size of the container argument using grid layout p the prefer width of a grid layout is the large prefer width of any of the component in the container time the number of column plus the horizontal padding time the number of column plus one plus the left and right inset of the target container p the prefer height of a grid layout is the large prefer height of any of the component in the container time the number of row plus the vertical padding time the number of row plus one plus the top and bottom inset of the target container param parent the container in which to the layout the prefer dimension to lay out the subcomponent of the specify container determine the minimum size of the container argument using grid layout p the minimum width of a grid layout is the large minimum width of any of the component in the container time the number of column plus the horizontal padding time the number of column plus one plus the left and right inset of the target container p the minimum height of a grid layout is the large minimum height of any of the component in the container time the number of row plus the vertical padding time the number of row plus one plus the top and bottom inset of the target container param parent the container in which to the layout the minimum dimension need to lay out the subcomponent of the specify container lay out the specify container using layout p method reshape the component in the specify target container in order to satisfy the constraint of the code vertical grid layout code object p the grid layout manager determine the size of individual component by divide the free space in the container into equal size portion accord to the number of row and column in the layout the container s free space equal the container s size minus any inset and any specify horizontal or vertical gap all component in a grid layout are given the same size param parent the container in which to the layout see java awt container see java awt container layout the string representation of grid layout s value a string representation of grid layout
