the graphical composite figure fill in the gap between a composite figure and other figure which mainly have a presentation purpose the graphical composite figure can be configure with any figure which take over the task rendering the graphical presentation a composite figure therefore the graphical composite figure manage contain figure like the composite figure doe but delegate it graphical presentation to another graphical figure which purpose it is to draw the container all contain figure the graphical composite figure add to the link composite figure composite figure by contain a presentation figure by which can not be remove normally the link composite figure composite figure can not be see without contain a figure because it ha no mechanism to draw itself it instead relie on it contain figure to draw themselve thereby giving the link composite figure composite figure it appearance howev the b graphical composite figure b s presentation figure can draw itself even when the b graphical composite figure b contain no other figure the b graphical composite figure b also us a link layout layout or layout it contain figure author wolfram kaiser original code wern randelshof derive version version 2 0 2006 01 14 change to support precision coordinate br 1 0 1 dezemb 2003 derive from jhotdraw 5 4b1 figure which perform all presentation task composite figure a composite figure usually don t have an own presentation but present only the sum of all it child handle figure change in the child constructor which us nothing a presentation figure constructor is need by the storable mechanism constructor which create a graphical composite figure with a given graphical figure present it param presentation figure figure which render the container the logcal display area method is delegate to the encapsulate presentation figure the draw area method is delegate to the encapsulate presentation figure move the figure is the method that subclasser override client usually call display box standard presentation method which is delegate to the encapsulate presentation figure the presentation figure is move a well a all contain figure draw the figure method is delegate to the encapsulate presentation figure handle from the presentation figure get presentation figure get handle set a figure which render composite figure the presentation task the composite figure are delegate to presentation figure param presentation figure figure take over the presentation task set presentation figure figure presentation figure presentation figure null presentation figure remove figure listener presentation figure handler presentation figure remove undoable edit listener presentation figure handler get drawing null presentation figure remove notify get drawing presentation figure presentation figure presentation figure null presentation figure add figure listener presentation figure handler presentation figure add undoable edit listener presentation figure handler get drawing null presentation figure add notify get drawing f i x m e we should calculate the layout here get a figure which render composite figure the presentation task the composite figure are delegate to presentation figure figure take over the presentation task figure get presentation figure presentation figure graphical composite figure clone graphical composite figure that graphical composite figure super clone that presentation figure presentation figure null ?
