implement java awt event key listener java awt event mouse listener java awt event mouse motion listener java util event listener figure listener tool connection tool tool figure listener the prototypical figure that is use to create connection create a instance specify by mouse move in java awt event mouse motion listener override mouse move in tool specify by mouse move in java awt event mouse motion listener override mouse move in tool manipulate connection in a context dependent way the mouse down hit a figure start a connection the mousedown hit a connection split a segment or join two segment specify by mouse press in java awt event mouse listener override mouse press in tool specify by mouse press in java awt event mouse listener override mouse press in tool adjust the create connection or split segment specify by mouse drag in java awt event mouse motion listener specify by mouse drag in java awt event mouse motion listener connect the figure the mouse is release over another figure specify by mouse release in java awt event mouse listener override mouse release in tool specify by mouse release in java awt event mouse listener override mouse release in tool description copy from tool activate the tool the given view method is call whenev the user to tool use method to reinitialize a tool note a valid view must be present in order the tool to accept activation specify by activate in tool override activate in tool specify by activate in tool override activate in tool description copy from tool deactivate the tool method is call whenev the user to another tool use method to some clean up when the tool is subclasser should alway call super deactivate specify by deactivate in tool override deactivate in tool specify by deactivate in tool override deactivate in tool create the connection figure by the figure prototype is clone find a connectable figure target find a connectable figure target find an exist connection figure get the connection which is create by tool description copy from tool draw the tool specify by draw in tool override draw in tool specify by draw in tool override draw in tool find a connection start figure get the figure that wa actually add note can be a different figure from the one which ha be create description copy from figure listener sent when an area use by the figure need to be repaint specify by figure area invalidate in figure listener specify by figure area invalidate in figure listener description copy from figure listener sent when a figure wa add to a drawing specify by figure add in figure listener specify by figure add in figure listener description copy from figure listener sent when the geometry e g the bound of the figure ha change specify by figure change in figure listener specify by figure change in figure listener description copy from figure listener sent when a figure wa remove from a drawing specify by figure remove in figure listener specify by figure remove in figure listener description copy from figure listener sent when the figure request to be remove from a drawing specify by figure request remove in figure listener specify by figure request remove in
