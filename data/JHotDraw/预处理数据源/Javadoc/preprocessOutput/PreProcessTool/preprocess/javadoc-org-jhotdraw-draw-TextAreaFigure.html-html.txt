text holder specify by set text in text holder description copy from figure set the logical bound of the figure and of it decorator figure is use by tool s which create a figure and by tool s which connect a figure to another figure is a basic operation which doe not fire event specify by basic set bound in figure parameter anchor the start point of the bound lead the end point of the bound see also figure get bound specify by basic set bound in figure parameter anchor the start point of the bound lead the end point of the bound see also figure get bound description copy from figure move the figure is the method that subclass override is a basic operation which no event are fire specify by basic transform in figure specify by basic transform in figure parameter tx the transformation specify by basic transform in figure specify by basic transform in figure parameter tx the transformation description copy from figure check a point is contain by the figure is use hit testing by tool

the logical bound are use by some handle object adjust the figure specify by get bound in figure specify by get bound in figure description copy from figure create handle use to manipulate the figure specify by create handle in figure override create handle in figure parameter detail level the detail level of the handle usually is 0 bound box handle and 1 point handle a collection of handle see also handle specify by create handle in figure override create handle in figure parameter detail level the detail level of the handle usually is 0 bound box handle and 1 point handle a collection of
