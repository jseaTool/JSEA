graphics2 d to draw to get the layer of the figure the layer is use to determine the z ordering of a figure inside of a drawing figure with a high layer number are draw after figure with a lower number the z order of figure within the same layer is determine by the sequence the figure be add to a drawing figure add late to a draw after figure which have be add before a figure change it layer it must fire a figure listener figure change event to it figure listener f i x m e replace value by a layer object a figure is only draw by a drawing and by composite figure it is visible layout s should ignore invisible figure too change the visible state of the figure the figure fire figure listener figure change and undoable edit listener undoable edit happen operation change it visible state set the logical bound of the figure and of it decorator figure is use by tool s which create a figure and by tool s which connect a figure to another figure is a basic operation which doe not

include the logical bound of the figure the prefer size is use by layout to determine the prefer size of a figure most figure s is the same a the dimension by get bound get data which can be use to restore the shape of the figure after a basic transform ha be apply to it see also basic transform affine transform see also basic transform affine transform restore the shape of the figure to a previously store state transform the shape of the figure transformation using precision arithmethic are inherently lossy operation therefore it is recommend to use get restore data restore to to provide lossles undo redo functionality after the transform ha finish the bound of the decorator figure are change to match the transform bound of the figure is a basic operation which doe not fire event parameter tx the transformation parameter tx the transformation set an attribute of the figure attribute key name and semantics are define by the implement the figure on an attribute change the figure fire figure listener figure attribute change undoable edit listener undoable edit happen the shape is affect by an attribute change figure listener figure change is fire too set an attribute of the figure without firing event attribute key name and semantics are define by the implement the figure use attribute key set typesafe access to method see also attribute key set org jhotdraw draw

specific connector different connection figure parameter p the location of the connector prototype the prototype use to create a connection or null unknown allow specific connector different connection figure get a compatible connector the provide connector is part of figure the connector the provide connector is part of another figure a connector with the same semantics figure null no compatible connector is available set wheth the connector should be visible the specify courting connector connector can be optionally visible true figure draw it connector check wheth the given figure is contain in figure a figure include itself the figure that contain the given point a decompositon of a figure into it part a figure is consider a a part of itself a clone of the figure after cloning a collection of figure the connection figure contain in collection still connect to the original figure instead of to the clone using operation and provide a map which map from the original collection of figure to the collection connection can be remapp to the figure inform a figure that it ha be add to the specify drawing the figure must inform all figure listener that it ha be add inform a figure that it ha be remove from the specify drawing the figure must inform all figure listener that it ha be remove inform that a figure is about to change it shape will change and change are typically use a pair before and after invoke one or multiple basic method on the figure inform that a figure change it shape fire a figure listener figure change event the current display bound of the figure see also will change see also will change inform that a figure ha invalidate it display area and need to be draw fire a figure listener area invalidate event fire a figure listener figure
