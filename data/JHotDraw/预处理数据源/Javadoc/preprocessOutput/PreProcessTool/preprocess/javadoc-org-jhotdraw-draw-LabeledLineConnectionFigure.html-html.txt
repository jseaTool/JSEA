encapsulate a layout algorithm figure typically a layout access the child component of figure and arrange their graphical presentation specify by get layout in composite figure layout strategy use by figure specify by get layout in composite figure layout strategy use by figure description copy from composite figure set a layout object which encapsulate a layout algorithm figure typically a layout access the child component of figure and arrange their graphical presentation it is a good idea to set the layout in the initialize method so it can be recreate a graphical composite figure is read

encapsulation of a layout algorithm a layout algorithm is use to define how the child component should be lay out in relation to each other the task layout the child component presentation is delegate
