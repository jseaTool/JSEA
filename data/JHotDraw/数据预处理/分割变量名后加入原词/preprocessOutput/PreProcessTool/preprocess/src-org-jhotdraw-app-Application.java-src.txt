interface Application application Launches launch the the application application from from the the main method This method is is typically typically invoked on on the the main Thread thread This will will invoke configure configure on on the the current current thread thread and and then then init init and and start start on on the the AWT a w t Event event Dispatcher dispatcher Thread thread public void launch launch String args Configures configure the the application application using using the the provided provide arguments argument array public void configure configure String args Initializes initializ the the application application code configure configure code should should have have been be invoked before before the the application application is is inited init Alternatively alternatively an an application application can can be be configured configure using using setter setter methods public void init init Starts start the the application application This usually usually creates create a a new project project and and adds add it it to to the the application application code init init code must must have have been be invoked before before the the application application is is started start public void start start Stops stop the the application application without without saving saving any any unsaved unsav projects project code init init code must must have have been be invoked before before the the application application is is stopped stop public void stop stop Creates create a a new project project for this application application

Project project p p Returns a a read read only only collection collection view view of of the the projects project of of this application application public Collection collection Project project projects project Returns the the current current project project This is is used use for OSXApplication o s x application and and MDIApplication m d i application which which share share actions action among among multiple multiple Project project instances instance Current current project project may may be be become become null if the the application application has ha no no project project p p This is is a a bound bound property property public Project project getCurrentProject get current project Returns the the enabled enable state state of of the the application application public boolean isEnabled is enable Sets set the the enabled enable state state of of the the application application The the enabled enable state state is is used use to to prevent prevent parallel parallel invocation invocation of of actions action on on the the application application If an an action action consists consist of of a a sequential sequential part part and and a a concurrent concurrent part part it it must must disable disable the the application application only only for the the sequential sequential part part Actions action that that act act on on the the application application must must check check in in their their actionPerformed action perform method whether wheth the the application application is is enabled enable If the the application application is is disabled disabled they they must must do nothing nothing If the the application application is is enabled enable they they must must disable disable the the application application perform perform the the action action and and then then enable enable the the application application again again This is is a a bound bound property property public void setEnabled set enable boolean newValue value Adds add
