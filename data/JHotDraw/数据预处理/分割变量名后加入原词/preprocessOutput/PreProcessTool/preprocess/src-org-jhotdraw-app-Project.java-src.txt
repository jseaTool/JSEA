getFile get Sets set the the project project file This is is a a bound bound property property public void setFile set File newValue value Returns the the enabled enable state state of of the the project project public boolean isEnabled is enable Sets set the the enabled enable state state of of the the project project The the enabled enable state state is is used use to to prevent prevent parallel parallel invocation invocation of of actions action on on the the project project If an an action action consists consist of of a a sequential sequential part part and and a a concurrent concurrent part part it it must must disable disable the the project project only only for the the sequential sequential part part Actions action that that act act on on the the project project must must check check in in their their actionPerformed action perform method whether wheth the the project project is is enabled enable If the the project project is is disabled disabled they they must must do nothing nothing If the the project project is is enabled enable they they must must disable disable the the project project perform perform the the action action and and then then enable enable the the project project again again This is is a a bound bound property property public void setEnabled set enable boolean newValue value Writes write the the project project to to the the

get save chooser Returns true if the the project project has ha unsaved unsav changes change This is is a a bound bound property property public boolean hasUnsavedChanges ha unsav change Marks mark all all changes change as a saved save This changes change the the state state of of hasUnsavedChanges ha unsav change to to false public void markChangesAsSaved mark change a save Executes execute the the specified specify runnable runnable on on the the worker worker thread thread of of the the project project Execution execution is is perfomred perfomr sequentially sequentially in in the the same same sequence sequence as a the the runnables runnable have have been be passed pass to to this method public void execute execute Runnable runnable worker worker Initializes initializ the the project project This is is invoked right right before before the the application application shows show the the project project A a project project must must not not consume consume many many resources resource before before method init init is is called call This is is crucial crucial for the the responsivenes responsivene of of an an application application public void init init Gets get rid rid of of all all the the resources resource of of the the project project No no other other methods should should be be invoked on on the the project project afterwards afterward A a project project must must not not consume consume many many resources resource after after method dispose dispose has ha been be called call This is is crucial crucial for the the responsivenes responsivene of of an an application application public void dispose dispose Returns the the action action with with the the specified specify id public Action action getAction get action String id Puts put an an

removePropertyChangeListener remove property change listener PropertyChangeListener property change listener l l Sets set the the multiple multiple open open id The the id is is used use to to help help distinguish distinguish multiply multiply opened open projects project The the id should should be be displayed display in in the the title title of of the the project project public void setMultipleOpenId set multiple open int newValue value Returns the the multiple multiple open open id If a a project project is is open open only only once once this should should be be 1 1 public int getMultipleOpenId get multiple open This is is used use by by Application application to to keep keep track track if a a project project is is showing showing public boolean isShowing is showing This
