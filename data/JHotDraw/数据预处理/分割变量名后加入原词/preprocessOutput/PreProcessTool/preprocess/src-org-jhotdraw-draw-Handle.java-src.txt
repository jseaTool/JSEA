Handles handle are are used use to to change change a a figure figure by by direct direct manipulation manipulation Handles handle know know their their owning own figure figure and and they they provide provide methods to to locate locate the the handle handle on on the the figure figure and and to to track track changes change p p Handles handle are are used use for user user interaction interaction Unlike unlike figures figure a a handle handle works work with with the the user user interface coordinates coordinate of of the the DrawingView drawing view The the user user interface coordinates coordinate are are expressed express in in integer pixels pixel author author Werner wern Randelshofer randelshof version 2 2 0 0 2006 2006 01 01 14 14 Changed change to to support support
